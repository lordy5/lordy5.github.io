        <h1>Project 2: Fun with Filters and Frequencies</h1>

        <h2>By Alex Becker</h2>

        <h2>Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h2>

        <p>First, we use the finite difference operator, [1, -1], as a filter on the cameraman image below. We use it as 
            a filter in both the x and y directions by convolving it with the image. Then, since we have the partial derivative 
            in both directions at each pixel, we can compute the gradient magnitude and display it as well. Finally, to try to 
            reduce noise, we can binarize the gradient magnitude using a threshold, which gives us an edge image.
        </p>

        <p>
            Specifically, for the gradient magnitude computation, we already have the partial derivatives in the x and y 
            direction at each pixel. These values stacked is the gradient at each pixel, and taking the 2-norm of the gradient 
            gives us the gradient magnitude at each pixel.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Part 1.2: Derivative of Gaussian Filter</h2>

        <p>The results above were somewhat noisy, as grass was often picked up if the threshold was not high enough, 
            but actual edges weren't picked up if we did raise the threshold. To improve this, we can first blur the image 
            by convolving it with a Gaussian kernel, which acts as a low pass filter, smoothing our image. Now we repeat the 
            same process as above on the smoothed image, which should give us better results.
        </p>

        <p>As we can see, this results in a much clearer and more defined edge around the cameraman and allows us 
            to change the threshold to pick up more edges without picking up noise.
        </p>

        <div class="grid">

        </div>

        <p>To get the above results, we performed two convolutions: one for smoothing the image, and one for getting the 
            partial derivatives. We can actually achieve these results with only one convolution on our image by convolving 
            the gaussian kernel with the finite difference operator, and then convolving the result of that with our image.
            Below you can see that we get the same result.

        <h2>Part 2.1: Image "Sharpening"</h2>

        <p>For this part we "sharpen" images using by utilizing a gaussian kernel again. Becuase using a Gaussian filter 
            filters out the high frequencies of an image, we can obtain just the high frequencies by subtracting the low 
            passed image from the original. Then we can add these high frequencies, scaled by some alpha, back to the 
            original image, making it appear sharpened. However, this can actually be achieved in just one convolution 
            by using a laplacian filter. Below are the results for 3 different images. For the City Hall image, I blurred it 
            first and then sharpened it to see if this would "restore" the appearance of the image.

        <h2>Part 2.2: Hybrid Images</h2>

        <p>Next we make hybrid images. We can do this by using what we learned in the previous parts about using the high 
            and low frequencies of an image. We know that we can get the low frequencies by applying a Gaussian filter, 
            and the high frequencies by subtracting the smoothed image from the original. Additionally, we know that when 
            looking at an image close up, we will be able to see the high frequencies, but if we back up, the low frequencies 
            will dominate as we won't be able to see the details of the high frequencies. Therefore, we can create hybrid images 
            by superimposing the high frequncies of one image over the low frequencies of the other. Then, depending on how close 
            or far we are to the result, we should see one image or the other. First, we see the results of this with Derek and 
            Nutmeg.
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
            <div>
                <div class="caption">Derek</div>

        </div>

        <p> For the next hybrid, I used a picture of my dad when he was in high school for the low frequencies, and a 
            picture of me when I was in high school for the high frequencies. This was my favorite result, and I think it 
            turned out well because we look similar enough so that there isn't too much "contradiction" between the low 
            frequencies from his picture with the high frequencies from mine. I think the low frequencies of his 
            actually help smooth out the high frequencies of mine, while mine gives more structure to his image which 
            has been blurred a lot.

        <p>(Failure) Lastly, I tried to create a hybrid of a plant and a tree, low passing the plant and high passing 
            the tree. I tried multiple different alignments and kernel sizes but couldn't get a working hybrid. I think one 
            issue is that the stucture of the images was not very similar, and the plant image in particular was much darker, 
            so it dominated too much even up close.

        <h2>Part 2.3: Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks</h2>

        <p>For this part, we perform mulitresolution blending to create a seamless transition between an apple and an orange 
            I did this with Gaussian and Laplacian stacks. A Gaussian stack differs from a Gaussian pyramid in that instead 
            of downscaling the image at each level, we just low pass the image, but it stays the same size. This allows us to 
            store a Gaussian stack of color images in a 4D array. Laplacian stacks are created by subtracting succesive layers 
            of the Gaussian stack from each other. Therefore, a Laplacian stack would have n - 1 layers if the Gaussian stack 
            has n, but we actually take the top level of the Gaussian stack (most blurred) and use it for the top layer of the 
            Laplacian stack as well. Therefore, the Laplacian stack contains frequency bands of the original image. To obtain 
            the original image, we can sum the levels of the Laplacian stack. To do the Multiresolution blending, we also create 
            a mask, and a Gaussian stack of the mask. Then we combine the images of our two inputs at each level of the Laplacian 
            stacks, using the corresponding mask at the same level of its Gaussian stack to create a smooth transition. In this 
            way, we are blending the images at each frequency band separately, leading to a much better result. Below is the result 
            for the apple and orange.

        <h2>Part 2.4: Multiresolution Blending</h2>

        <p>For this part, I perform the same multiresolution blending described above on some images of my choice, some with 
            an irregular mask instead of the step function mask used for the oraple.
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
            <div>
                <div class="caption">Soup</div>

        </div>

        <p>This one was my favorite result because it's very simple, but I think the multiresolution blending works really 
            well for the soup, and the gradual blending between the two looks pretty natural, and what we would expect for 
            two liquids. The figure below shows the masked inputs of the Laplacian stacks, as well as the combined results.

        <p>Next I thought it would be interesting to find images of ocean water and a pool from similar angles, and then 
            perform multiresolution blending to make it appear that there is a patch of ocean water inside a pool. I think it 
            turned out pretty well, but would look better with a more natural shaped mask.

        </div>

        <p>(Failure) Finally, I tried to use multiresolution blending to take an image of a plant and make it appear to be 
            on top of a shelf. I tried using different masks and Gaussian kernels, but couldn't get good results. I think this 
            is mainly because the angle is slightly different, so it looks unnatural no matter what, but also becuase the backround 
            color of the plant image is slightly different, so you can see discoloring just around the plant. Additionally the surface 
            that the plant was on is a different material than the shelf, and the shadow of the plant gets cut off when blending. These 
            factors result in the blending not working very well.
