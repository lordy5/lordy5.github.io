        <h2>Exhaustive Search for Small Images</h2>
        <p>First, I implemented an exhaustive search to align the image channels for the provided jpeg images. Specifically, 
            I wrote a function called <em>align</em> which takes in two image channels as inputs, as well as a range of how
            many pixels to search in each direction, and an offset for where to start searching. The function works by 
            considering every possible displacement of one channel with respect to the other, starting from the provided 
            offset and within the provided range (for example (-15, 15)). To "score" each possible displacement, I initially
            used Euclidean distance between the two arrays (one for each channel), then switched to Normalized Cross 
            Correlation which had better results. However, as I will explain later, due to one particular image I changed 
            <em>align</em> to first perform Sobel edge detection on each channel, and then compute the Euclidean distance 
            between the detected edges. For the provided jpeg images, I just called <em>align</em> twice, passing in the 
            blue channel as the reference both times with either the red or green channel as well. 
            I additionally cropped each channel by 10% on each side in order to remove some borders which were 
            causing my algorithm no not align the channels correctly. When calling <em>align</em>, I used an offset of zero 
            with a range of 15 pixels. These were the resulting images:

        <h2>Image Pyramid for Larger Images</h2>
        <p>For the larger TIF images, I implemented an image pyramid to align the channels, as just doing the exhaustive 
            search would take too long for the larger images. Specifically, I created a recursive function called 
            <em>pyramid</em> which itself calls the same <em>align</em> function used previously. The <em>pyramid</em> 
            function takes in 2 channels, a range to search for possible displacements, and the number of levels to 
            use for the image pyramid as parameters. The function downsamples each channel by a factor of 2, and then 
            recursively uses the coarse displacement determined from the downsampled level and refines it by calling 
            <em>align</em> and passing in that coarse displacement. This results in obtaining a more refined displacement 
            without doing an exhaustive search at the current level. When recursively calling <em>pyramid</em> on the 
            downsampled images, we must also divide the search range by 2, since each pixel in the downsampled image 
            represents 2 pixels in the full sized image. Similar to previous part, I called the function twice, passing 
            in the blue channel as the reference along with either the red or green channel. I also used 9 levels in the 
            pyramids, with a search range of 30 pixels.

        <h2>Difficulties with the Emir</h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, the image that gave me the most trouble to align was the Emir of Bukhara. In my initial 
            implementation where I used NCC on the raw pixel values for each channel, I was able to get almost all of the 
            other TIF images to align well. I also cropped 15% from the edges of each channel which resulted in all of the 
            images aligning well except for the Emir of Bukhara, which looked like this (tried to recreate it since I did 
            not save the misaligned image at the time):
        </p>
        <img src="media/emir_fail.jpg" alt="emir fail" style="width: 40%">
        <p> This is what led me to use Sobel edge detection on each channel in the <em>align</em> method, and then use 
            the Euclidean distance between the results of the edge detection for each channel to "score" the alignment. 
            This worked well for all other images, but the Emir was still not aligned correctly and looked the same as 
            with my previous method. This led me to actually display the resulting edges from the edge detection on each 
            channel. I that some of the prominent edges being detected were the vertical lines in the background, such 
            as the one between the door and the wall, and the one between two different wall materials:
        </p>
        <img src="media/emir_edges.jpg" alt="emir edges" style="width: 40%">
        <p>
            Because of this, I suspect that maybe these edges are more significant than the other edges being detected, 
            and as a result, because the two different vertical lines would probably result in very similar edges, my 
            algorithm might be aligning the different channels incorrectly by aligning different vertical edges from each 
            one. For example, the edge between the door and wall in the red channel might be aligned with the edge between 
            the two wall materials in the blue channel. Because of this, changed my function to use only horizontal Sobel 
            edge detection, meaning only horizontal edges would be detected, ignoring the problematic vertical edges. 
            Fortunately this fixed the issue, and the Emir was now aligned correctly. Luckily, this adjustment still 
            worked on all of the other images.

        <h2>
            Bells and Whistles
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first Bell and Whistle addition I have already explained above, which was using edge detection 
            to align the channels rather than working with the raw pixel values. For the second Bell and Whistle 
            addition, I added automatic contrasting because I noticed that the some of the images looked a bit 
            washed out, most notably the "melons" image where we can see that the very dark areas have a green 
            haze over them, and it doesn't look as dark as it should. To do the auto contrasting, I added a function 
            called <em>adjust_contrast</em> which takes one channel as input, and then shrinks or stretches the 
            intensity levels using the <em>rescale_intensity</em> function from skimage. After some tweaking, I 
            found that rescaling by using using the second percentile of intensity as 0, and the 98th percentile 
            of intensity as 1, had good results. Below are some of the images that I found were most improved by 
            this auto contrasting: left is before and right is after
