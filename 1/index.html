        <h2>Exhaustive Search for Small Images</h2>
        <p>First, I implemented an exhaustive search to align the image channels for the provided jpeg images. Specifically, 
            I wrote a function called <em>align</em> which takes in two image channels as inputs, as well as a range of how
            many pixels to search in each direction, and an offset for where to start searching. The function works by 
            considering every possible displacement of one channel with respect to the other, starting from the provided 
            offset and within the provided range (for example (-15, 15)). To "score" each possible displacement, I initially
            used Euclidean distance between the two arrays (one for each channel), then switched to Normalized Cross 
            Correlation which had better results. However, as I will explain later, due to one particular image I changed 
            <em>align</em> to first perform Sobel edge detection on each channel, and then compute the Euclidean distance 
            between the detected edges. For the provided jpeg images, I just called <em>align</em> twice, passing in the 
            blue channel as the reference both times with either the red or green channel as well. 
            I additionally cropped each channel by 10% on each side in order to remove some borders which were 
            causing my algorithm no not align the channels correctly. When calling <em>align</em>, I used an offset of zero 
            with a range of 15 pixels. These were the resulting images:
